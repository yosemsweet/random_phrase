== DESCRIPTION:

random_phrase generates a random phrase from phrase list. The code is heavily based off [randexp]https://github.com/benburkert/randexp but allows you to load your word list via custom loaders instead of only supporting your users dictionary.

== REQUIREMENTS:
 
* ActiveSupport 3 (you'll get this with bundle install)
 
== INSTALL:
 
  $ gem install random_phrase

== USAGE:

Random_phrase works by initializing a dictionary for the RandomPhrase class and then calling RandomPhrase.phrase with options.

  #can run in config file
  RandomPhrase.dictionary= RandomPhrase::Dictionary.new(Proc.new {["my", "test", "word", "list", "is", "super"]})
  
  #in source
  RandomPhrase.phrase #returns one of: my test word list is super
  
You can pass the length of the phrase desired
  a_two_word_phrase = RandomPhrase.phrase(2)
  
You can also pass the target letter count for words
  a_two_word_phrase_of_four_letter_words = RandomPhrase.phrase(2, :length => 4)
  
You can also ask for phrase by regexp
 a_pattern_matched_phrase = RandomPhrase(/\wy [a-zA-Z]+er\s\w{4}/) #will return "my super [word|test|list]"
  
== Valid Regexp's

I haven't tested with all regexps. Your mileage may vary here.

= Dictionary
By default the dictionary loads a text file in config/words
The words file should have a new word on each line.

You can also initialize your dictionary via a proc that returns an array of strings.
